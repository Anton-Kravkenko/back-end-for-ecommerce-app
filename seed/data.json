			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div>  <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div>  <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode.

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div>  <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div>  <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie.

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in.

The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in.

The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in.

This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling.

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling.

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies.

			"<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

			"Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar Games has yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles.  In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on the Xbox 360.  <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. <br /> <br />This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive (sold separately) with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance. "

			"Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar Games has yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles.  In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on the Xbox 360.  <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. <br /> <br />This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive (sold separately) with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance. "

			"Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar Games has yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles.  In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on the Xbox 360.  <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. <br /> <br />This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive (sold separately) with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance. "

Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

			"THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.hese concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes.

			"For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking —selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

			"Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

			"In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

			"THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.hese concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

			"Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

			"In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

			"THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.hese concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

			"<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks : Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

			"<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks : Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

			"For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking —selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.

			"For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking —selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

			"Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

			"In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

			"THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.hese concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

			"Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

			"In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

			"THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.hese concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

			"<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks : Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

			"<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks : Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

			"For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking —selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

			"For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking —selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

			"Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

			"In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

			"THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.hese concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

			"<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks : Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions.

For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not!

Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

			"Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

			"Few mixtures are as toxic as absolute power and insanity. When nothing stands between a leader's delusion whims and seeing them carried them out, all sorts of bizarre outcomes are possible.  Whether it is Ottoman Sultan Ibrahim I practicing archery on palace servants and sending out his advisers to find the fattest woman in the empire for his wife or Turkmenistan President Turkmenbashi renaming the days of the week after himself and constructing an 80-foot golden statue that revolves to face the sun, crazed leaders have plagued society for millenia. This book will look at the lives of the ten most mentally unbalanced figures in history. Some suffered from genetic disorders that led to schizophrenia, such as French King Charles VI, who thought he was made of glass. Others believed themselves to be God’s representatives on earth and wrote religious writings that they guaranteed to the reader would get them into heaven, even if they were barely literate.  Whatever their background, these rulers show that dynastic politics made sure that a rightful heir always got on the throne – despite that heir's mental condition – and that power can destroy a mind worse than any mental illness."

And to make this richly illustrated book even richer, each chapter invites the reader along for an interactive experience through the addition of removable facsimile documents—the evidence! It's a treasure trove for conspiracy buffs, a <em>Griffin and Sabine</em> for history lovers. Adapted from <em>Decoded</em>, Meltzer’s hit show on the HISTORY network, <em>History Decoded</em> explores fascinating, unexplained questions. Is Fort Knox empty? Why was Hitler so intent on capturing the Roman “Spear of Destiny”? What’s the government hiding in Area 51? Where did the Confederacy’s $19 million in gold and silver go at the end of the Civil War? And did Lee Harvey Oswald really act alone? Meltzer sifts through the evidence; weighs competing theories;  separates what we know to be true with what’s still—and perhaps forever—unproved or unprovable; and in the end, <em>decodes</em> the mystery, arriving at the most likely solution. Along the way we meet Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Nazi propagandists, and the <em>real</em> DB Cooper. Bound in at the beginning of each story is a custom-designed envelope—a faux 19th-century leather satchel, a U.S. government classified file—containing facsimiles of relevant evidence: John Wilkes Booth’s alleged unsigned will, a map of the Vatican, Kennedy’s death certificate.

			"Few mixtures are as toxic as absolute power and insanity. When nothing stands between a leader's delusion whims and seeing them carried them out, all sorts of bizarre outcomes are possible.  Whether it is Ottoman Sultan Ibrahim I practicing archery on palace servants and sending out his advisers to find the fattest woman in the empire for his wife or Turkmenistan President Turkmenbashi renaming the days of the week after himself and constructing an 80-foot golden statue that revolves to face the sun, crazed leaders have plagued society for millenia. This book will look at the lives of the ten most mentally unbalanced figures in history. Some suffered from genetic disorders that led to schizophrenia, such as French King Charles VI, who thought he was made of glass. Others believed themselves to be God’s representatives on earth and wrote religious writings that they guaranteed to the reader would get them into heaven, even if they were barely literate.  Whatever their background, these rulers show that dynastic politics made sure that a rightful heir always got on the throne – despite that heir's mental condition – and that power can destroy a mind worse than any mental illness."

And to make this richly illustrated book even richer, each chapter invites the reader along for an interactive experience through the addition of removable facsimile documents—the evidence! It's a treasure trove for conspiracy buffs, a <em>Griffin and Sabine</em> for history lovers. Adapted from <em>Decoded</em>, Meltzer’s hit show on the HISTORY network, <em>History Decoded</em> explores fascinating, unexplained questions. Is Fort Knox empty? Why was Hitler so intent on capturing the Roman “Spear of Destiny”? What’s the government hiding in Area 51? Where did the Confederacy’s $19 million in gold and silver go at the end of the Civil War? And did Lee Harvey Oswald really act alone? Meltzer sifts through the evidence; weighs competing theories;  separates what we know to be true with what’s still—and perhaps forever—unproved or unprovable; and in the end, <em>decodes</em> the mystery, arriving at the most likely solution. Along the way we meet Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Nazi propagandists, and the <em>real</em> DB Cooper. Bound in at the beginning of each story is a custom-designed envelope—a faux 19th-century leather satchel, a U.S. government classified file—containing facsimiles of relevant evidence: John Wilkes Booth’s alleged unsigned will, a map of the Vatican, Kennedy’s death certificate.

Adapted from <em>Decoded</em>, Meltzer’s hit show on the HISTORY network, <em>History Decoded</em> explores fascinating, unexplained questions. Is Fort Knox empty? Why was Hitler so intent on capturing the Roman “Spear of Destiny”? What’s the government hiding in Area 51? Where did the Confederacy’s $19 million in gold and silver go at the end of the Civil War? And did Lee Harvey Oswald really act alone? Meltzer sifts through the evidence; weighs competing theories;  separates what we know to be true with what’s still—and perhaps forever—unproved or unprovable; and in the end, <em>decodes</em> the mystery, arriving at the most likely solution. Along the way we meet Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Nazi propagandists, and the <em>real</em> DB Cooper. Bound in at the beginning of each story is a custom-designed envelope—a faux 19th-century leather satchel, a U.S. government classified file—containing facsimiles of relevant evidence: John Wilkes Booth’s alleged unsigned will, a map of the Vatican, Kennedy’s death certificate. The whole is a riveting, interactive adventure through the compelling world of mysteries and conspiracies.</p>"

			"This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

			"This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing.

			"This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

			"This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

			"This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

			"<DIV><p><B>For Kids Aged 10+ (And Their Parents)</B><br><br></p><p><b>The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!</b></p><p>Python is a powerful, expressive programming language that's easy to learn and fun to use! But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids  brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids  is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

			"This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

			"Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

			"Commander Jonathan Radec is a man desperately trying to escape from the mistakes of his past.   Now the owner of Vanguard Shipping, his primary concerns are trying to keep his ships flying and his crew alive.  However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell. Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive. The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

			"When starfighter pilot Simon Dodds is enrolled in a top secret military project, he and his wingmates begin to suspect that there is a lot more to the theft of a legendary battleship and an Imperial nation's civil war than either the Confederation Stellar Navy or the government are willing to let on. Within weeks of being reassigned to the Confederate border system of Temper, the five would begin to untangle a web of lies and a cover-up that seemed to span the length of the entire galaxy. And it would not be long before they themselves would come face to face with that which destroyed an empire: an unforgiving, unstoppable, and totally unrelenting foe. There seemed to exist only one glimmer of hope of driving back the darkness: The ATAF Project - a secretly developed set of starfighters that may well just harbour some terrible secrets of their own. Reviews: \"A tightly plotted action-adventure yarn with a good mix of likeable, interesting and nasty characters\"  \"Written with perspicacity and drive, with a strong voice and good attention to detail.\" 124,000 words<br />~ 450 pages"

			"The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen. Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die. Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love. Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone! At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."
